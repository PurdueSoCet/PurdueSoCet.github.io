Welcome to the Purdue SoCet (System-on-Chip Extension Technologies) homepage!

Our goal is to provide students with a fully developed industry-style SoC design flow.  Students will gain experience with RTL design, formal verifcation methodologies, PCB design and bringup, synthesis and place and route tools, and software drivers.

Our website is still under construction and content is being regularly updated, so please bear with us.
